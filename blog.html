        <h2>Climate change: How to be more eco-friendly in everyday life</h2>
        <h3>We've been hearing so much about climate change recently, and the facts don't look good.</h3>
        <p>The evidence shows that, thanks to human activity, global temperatures are rising at a level which is no longer sustainable for the environment to survive. A landmark report by UN scientists has been described as a "code red for humanity", as it details grim realities such as rising sea levels, and more intense and frequent heatwaves.</p>
        <p>A recent survey - which included over half a million 14 to 18 year olds - suggests people are in favour of policy changes to boost renewable power and sustainable jobs.</p>

        <p>But on an everyday level, what can we actually do? How can we make a difference when it seems like everything has a bad impact on the climate?</p>
        <p>The first is not to beat yourself up if you forget your bag for life or your reusable cup - it will probably just add to your eco-anxiety. And of course, all our bloggers share is probably the one which involves the biggest change.It's about living a minimal lifestyle - cutting out needless buys.</p>

        <h2>Dont blame Instagram for the rise of botox and lip fillers</h2>
        <p>A new report rightly suggests that non-surgical cosmetic procedures need tighter regulation, but stumbles by blaming selfies and social media for their popularity</p>
        <p>Another day, another moral panic over what the youth of today are getting up to. This time its over the fact that our appearance-obsessed selfie culture is apparently driving them to cosmetic procedures, such as getting botox injections, dermal and lip fillers and skin lightening. After all, doesnt every girl want to look like Kim Kardashian?</p>
        <img src="C:\Users\CHANG\Downloads\Dermal-Fillers-All-You-Need-To-Know.jpg" width="600">
        <p> the impermanence of Botox means that even if an injector overdoes the dosage, it will wear off without long-term facial alteration. With continued high doses, your muscles can technically atrophy, or lose their strength. But with other muscles moving in the face, thats not something youll necessarily notice, Dr. Farhang said, and some research has shown that if you take a break from Botox, those muscles rebuild.</p>
        <p>A great complexion is not something you are simply born with. You simply have to just take good care of it and be mindful of the food you consume.</p>
